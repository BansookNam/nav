## Install

Add nav dependency on your pubspec.yaml file

```yaml
nav: ^{latest version}
```

## Usage

1. Add mixin "Nav" on your App State

```dart
import 'package:nav/nav.dart';

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with Nav 
```

2. Overide "get navigatorKey method" and provide key which you use in MaterialApp.navigatorKey

```dart
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  static GlobalKey<NavigatorState> navigatorKey = GlobalKey();
  // This widget is the root of your application.

  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with Nav {
  @override
  GlobalKey<NavigatorState> get navigatorKey => MyApp.navigatorKey;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      navigatorKey: navigatorKey,
...
```

3. Use push methods

```dart
Nav.pushFromRight(Widget)
Nav.pushFromLeft(Widget)
Nav.pushFromTop(Widget)
Nav.pushFromBottom(Widget)
Nav.pushReplacement(Widget)
Nav.clearAllAndPush(Widget)
```

4. All methods can return value

```dart
//from bottom screen
final result = await Nav.pushFromRight( TopScreen ) //you can get result from TopWidget

//from top screen
Nav.pop(context, result: {"key": "value", "key2": 2})
```



4. If you want to use ripple push please initialize Nav before use.

```dart
 //This should be called inside layer of Material App Widget (just once any where)
@override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    Nav.initInsideOfApp();
  }
```
